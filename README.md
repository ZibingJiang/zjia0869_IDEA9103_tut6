#### The imaging effect I found is from The Matrix. This scene is an image composed of code data. Although this is an imaging effect from a long time ago, it still has a sense of technology. I hope to be able to use this data or other small elements in the main project to compose an artwork.

#### I found the ASCII text-to-image technology to achieve the above imaging effect. This technology is achieved by converting pexels in the picture into text. This technology can be linked to the camera, which means that this effect can not only change the style of the artwork, but may also be used to create human images. Interaction with the picture, for example, people can push elements in the artwork.
