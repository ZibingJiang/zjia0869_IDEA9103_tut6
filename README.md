##### The imaging effect I found is from The Matrix. This scene is an image composed of code data. Although this is an imaging effect from a long time ago, it still has a sense of technology. I hope to be able to use this data or other small elements in the main project to compose an artwork.

#### I found the ASCII text-to-image technology to achieve the above imaging effect. This technology is achieved by converting pexels in the picture into text. This technology can be linked to the camera, which means that this effect can not only change the style of the artwork, but may also be used to create human images. Interaction with the picture, for example, people can push elements in the artwork.

##### I also want to achieve another imaging effect. This kind of effect when the mouse slides over the black and white picture will appear as a color picture. I think if it can be combined with a projection or screen, the interaction between people and the picture can be realized through code, and the human hand can draw It will be very attractive to change the artwork from black and white to color. But I haven't found the right code to do it yet.
